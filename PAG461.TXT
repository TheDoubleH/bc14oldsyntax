                ToolTipML=ENU=Specifies if value entries are automatically posted to the inventory account, adjustment account, and COGS account in the general ledger when an item transaction is posted. Alternatively, you can manually post the values at regular intervals with the Post Inventory Cost to G/L batch job. Note that costs must be adjusted before posting to the general ledger.;

                ToolTipML=ENU=Specifies if value entries originating from receipt or shipment posting, but not from invoice posting are recoded in the general ledger. Expected costs represent the estimation of, for example, a purchased item's cost that you record before you receive the invoice for the item. To post expected costs, interim accounts must exist in the general ledger for the relevant posting groups. Expected costs are only managed for item transactions, not for immaterial transaction types, such as capacity and item charges.;

    { 36  ;2   ;Field     ;
                ToolTipML=ENU=Specifies if item value entries are automatically adjusted when an item transaction is posted. This ensures correct inventory valuation in the general ledger, so that sales and profit statistics are up to date. The cost adjustment forwards any cost changes from inbound entries, such as those for purchases or production output, to the related outbound entries, such as sales or transfers. To minimize reduced performance during posting, select a time option to define how far back in time from the work date an inbound transaction can occur to potentially trigger adjustment of related outbound value entries. Alternatively, you can manually adjust costs at regular intervals with the Adjust Cost - Item Entries batch job.;

                ToolTipML=ENU=Specifies how your items' cost flow is recorded and whether an actual or budgeted value is capitalized and used in the cost calculation. Your choice of costing method determines how the unit cost is calculated by making assumptions about the flow of physical items through your company. A different costing method on item cards will override this default. For more information, see "Design Details: Costing Methods" in Help.;

Item & Location & Variant: An average cost per item for each location and for each variant of the item in the company is calculated. This means that the average cost of this item depends on where it is stored and which variant, such as color, of the item you have selected.;
